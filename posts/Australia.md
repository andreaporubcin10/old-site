> Three desserts that originate in Australia

Australia seems like the perfect summer vacation destination with the Great Barrier Reef, Sydney Opera House,
and many National Parks and beaches to explore and have adventures with family and friends and the number of delicious desserts is limitless!

## Pavlova

There have been disagreements between Pavlova being originated in Australia or New Zealand but both countries
make it for celebrations or special occasions as well as making it all year. This dish was said to have been 
made in honor of a famous ballerina Anna Pavlova and is topped with fruits of any kind.

## Lamington

Lamington originated in Brisbane and is a sponge cake dipped in chocolate and sprinkled in coconut shavings.
It was said to be created by accident by Lord Lamington's maid when she dropped a cake in melted chocolate. The 
Lord suggested the cake be covered in coconut shavings to prevent chocolate covered hands. Lamiington is found everywhere
and used for any occasion.

## Vanilla Slice

You would think this dessert is a cake but its actually vanilla flavored custard sandwiched between puff or phyllo 
pastry sheets. It is then topped with icing (usually fruit flavored). This dessert is used in competitions for the 
best Vanilla Slice maker. Maybe if you make this dessert enough you can create your unique Vanilla slice and participate
in the competition!
