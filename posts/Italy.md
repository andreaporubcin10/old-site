# Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

> Three desserts that originate in Italy

I have always wanted to go to Italy and try their desserts, pasta, pizza, everything to do with food! Here 
are some dessert recipies that made my mouth water! Some of these you can even try and make yourself!

## Sfogliatella

Sfogliatella was created by a pastry chef in Naples by the name of Pasquale Pintauro who began making and selling
this dessert in 1818. Sfogliatella means "small, thin leaf/layer" (but can also mean lobster tail) and is filled with ricotta
cheese and can be customized with anything you desire!

## Holy Canoli!

Cannoli is a well known Italian dessert that originated in Sicily for Carnivale (similar to Mardi Gras) celebrations. 
It can come in sizes as big as a hotdog or as small as a person's finger! Even though they were made for special events 
back then, they are now eaten all year for dessert. Cannolis are made with ricotta cheese and sprinkled inside with chocolate
chips wrapped in a shell.

## Tiramisu

I can't think of anyone who hasn't heard of Tiramisu. The soaked coffee smelling ladyfingers creamed with marscapone 
is iconic and will never be forgotten. It originated in Friuli-Venezia Guilia in the early 1980s and is now known and made
all over the world.
